    "description": "The aim of the assignment was to create static generative art. In order to achieve this, I wanted to use randomness and repetition. I started by creating an ellipse and playing around with it. Then I created lines that were half the size of the ellipse. After that I used rotation and made 8 equal pieces using lines. I wanted to change the color of the balls every time the page was refreshed using the random function. I used a for loop and applied this shape through the page. ",
    "background": "I came up with this idea while watching a tutorial from Matthew Epler about P5.js. In his tutorial, he created an ellipse and created lines and I tried to repeat the same steps. I wrote the wrong number by accident, but I really like the revised shape with more lines. Afterward, I wanted to repeated the shape. The last thing I wanted to do was change the color, so I used a random function to pick the colors.",

    "description": "My purpose was to create an interactive art project, and I started by looking for examples that might inspire me. As I went through the examples Garrit showed us during the lecture, I found an example called Grid. To understand how it works, I started playing around and changing rectangles to ellipses. In my version, I increased the number of shapes to 100, reduced the gap between shapes to 7 and reduced the size of the shapes to 10. By using the math random function, I was able to change the colors randomly to redish colors to make it interactive.",
    "background": "I came up with this idea while looking for examples Garrit provided during the lecture. Instead of rectangles, I used small ellipses to increase the number of shapes in the example. It happened spontaneously since I didn't plan to make something like that.",

Therefore, I began watching a video series by Daniel Shiffman called the Nature of Code. In his video, he created a rectangle and explained acceleration and velocity. I created a new shape using ellipses and made it look like a flower to understand it on my own. After that, I applied the same steps as in the video and played around with the numbers to make the shape move faster and increase its size. I used if blocks to decrease the size of the shape after one point since it was growing every time.",

My first step was to look at the examples provided during the lecture in order to gain a better understanding of that. The first thing I did was play around with the numbers in the javascript file and see what effect they had on the project. By increasing the noise seed, I was able to create a project that looked like the sky. Because of that, I decided to use shades of blue in the design. As there were a variety of options at that time, I was not sure which function I should use to change the colours. Therefore, I asked chatgpt for some examples I could use. From there, I used the map function to create sky-like blue colours. In the final step, I multiplied the frame count by 0.05 to move the sky.",
    "background": "I got inspired from Garrits' example and Gorilla Sun's Perlin Noise tutorial to create a pattern that looks like sky using Perlin Noise. The blue color is often associated with the sky, so I chose shades of blue for this project.",
